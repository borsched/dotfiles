# dotfiles

These are various configuration files for programs I use.

## zsh plugins
I use [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to manage my zsh plugins.
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

## nvim plugins
I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage my neovim
plugins.

Remember to make `.dwm/autostart.sh` an executable file.
